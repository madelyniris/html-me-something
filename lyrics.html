          well if you never jump you'll never know <br />
          if the water is as cold as they said <br />
          a kind of rebirth from the undertones <br />
          and all the words they try to get in your head <br />
          fall in line <br />
          take your time if that's all you have <br />
          speak your mind if you have to <br />
          step in reverse, a dagger under your skirt <br />
          oh you know <br />
          oh that everyone's waiting for chances <br />
          getting high and romancing the truth <br />
          and everyone is staring at you <br />
          well if you never jump you'll never now <br />
          if you were made to take the crash <br />
          a kind of reject of the beautiful <br />
          and all the things they try to sell you <br />
          fall in line <br />
          take your time if that's all you have <br />
          speak your mind if you have to <br />
          step in reverse, a dagger under your skirt <br />
          oh you know <br />
          oh that everyone's waiting for chances <br />
          getting high and romancing the truth <br />
          and everyone is staring at you <br />
          whatcha gonna do now that everyone found out? <br />
          step in reverse, a dagger under your skirt <br />
          oh you know <br />
          oh that everyone's waiting for chances <br />
          getting high and romancing the truth <br />
          and everyone is staring at you <br />
