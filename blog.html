            I've been a musician since the day I was born. Both of my parents are musicians, although very different kinds.
            My mom is a choir director and a classically trained soprano and pianist. My dad loves post-punk and riffs. So I grew up
            singing classically, but in the last 5 years I've been lucky enough to tour the entire United States in a punk/metal band
            called Mocklove. <br />

            I've been so incredibly lucky to meet some of my best friends (here is a Good One&trade;, his name is Ken and tours the entire world).

            <br />
            And I even met my incredible partner while both his band and my band were on tour. We played the same show. <br />

            (That's him up there. He may look scary but he's the sweetest most gentle person in the world.)

            <br />
            My music career has led to some crazy stuff! Outside of touring, I compose, produce, and engineer music, as well as consult for an audio-branding company based out of the UK.
            Well, at least I was consulting BEFORE the pandemic.
            <br />
            Here is a very awesome gig I accidentally stumbled into -- Giorgio Armani used one of my pop songs in 2017 for their Fall/Winter ad campaign.<br />
            My music was heard on New York and Paris Fashion Week runways. <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Other than that, my musical direction and compositions have been used for commercial purposes by many large and small businesses across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now St. Louis!

            <br />
            Now you know a little bit about my background and some of the cool stuff I've done. Upwards and onwards! Fight the good fight!
